# Machine Learning Python 

I'm currently reading [Introduction to Machine  Learning with Python](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030515.do) by Sarah Guido and Andreas MÃ¼ller.
I'm really enjoying the reading. The book present many Machine Learning algorithms and a wide range of interesting examples.
So I decided to create this repository to store cool things I'm doing while reading and learning about Machine Learning.
